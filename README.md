# Testing Your React App After Uploading to S3

Follow these steps to ensure your React app is working correctly after uploading to an AWS S3 bucket.

---

## 1. Access the S3 Static Website URL

1. **Locate the Endpoint**:
   - Go to the [AWS S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/).
   - Navigate to your S3 bucket.
   - Open the **Properties** tab.
   - Scroll down to the **Static website hosting** section.
   - Copy the **Endpoint URL** provided.

2. **Test in a Browser**:
   - Paste the **Endpoint URL** into your browser.
   - Verify that your React app loads properly.

---

## 2. Verify Navigation and Routing

1. **Check the Homepage**:
   - Ensure that the default homepage of your app (e.g., `/`) loads as expected.

2. **Test Other Routes**:
   - Navigate to other routes in your app (e.g., `/all_doc`, `/modify`) to confirm they work correctly.
   - Ensure the app handles React Router paths without showing a 404 error.

3. **Handle Refresh Issues**:
   - If refreshing a route causes a 404 error, verify that the **Error document** is set to `index.html` in the S3 **Static Website Hosting** configuration.

---

## 3. Test API Integration

1. **Test API Requests**:
   - Verify that all API calls from your React app to the backend services are functioning correctly.
   - Open the browserâ€™s developer tools (`Ctrl + Shift + I` or `Cmd + Option + I`) and check the **Network** tab for API request/response details.


## 4. Cross-Browser Testing

1. Test the app in multiple browsers:
   - **Chrome**
   - **Firefox**
   - **Safari**
   - **Edge**
2. Confirm consistent behavior and appearance across all tested browsers.
